ThePatriotsGuy	Caesar	1255119374203195392		2020-11-16 18:53:00	One of the most exciting parts about Kyle Dugger‚Äôs performance against the #Ravens last night was him being involved in two near takeaways. 1 on a near pick against the TE &amp; 1 on a near fumble on the RB. Also saw him ripping at the ball on several more plays.
ghostofchicken	Aaron	1540172683	Vancouver, Canada	2020-11-16 18:51:23	The #Ravens' OL decisions baffle me. -Skura clearly can't snap right now so why keep him at C if Mekari is *already* playing regardless? -Fluker is a longtime G who is way too slow to handle faster outside rushers but still a pretty stout run blocker. Why only use him at tackle?
dtgordo	Still Ravens. Still Purple and Black	294194778	Jonesboro, AR	2020-11-16 18:51:14	#Ravens should be calling every free agent WR. They need help big time. Play Duvernay over Brown. He seems more competent.

Lamar Jackson‚Äôs decline in rush numbers  Thru 9 games...  2019- 702 rush yards(3 100+ rush yard games) &amp; 6 TDs  2020- 524 rush yards(1 100+ rush yard game) &amp; 3 TDs  #NFL

TheMattWise	Matt Wise	2178995913	Maryland, USA	2020-11-16 11:29:41	The @Ravens loss on #SNF reinforced some old #NFL axioms.  ‚û°Ô∏è "You can never have too many corners". Tramon Williams was the #Ravens 3rd CB.  ‚û°Ô∏è "The game is won, or lost, in the trenches". Without a good offensive line, a team cannot hope to consistently win games.  #RavensFlock

I liked the dump-offs to the backs. Conditions were awful &amp; he made some pinpoint throws. Obviously Skura has been doing him a disservice as well. #Ravens

I've really seen a team fall from looking nearly invincible a year ago, to a completely pathetic bunch with no excuses of massive injuries or loss of personnel. They are the same team and they went from the penthouse with a bee line to the outhouse.

itsahooded4iron	Drew Forrester	28445379	Parkville, MD	2020-11-16 03:03:02	One thing #Ravens can't have on this drive is a turnover.    A punt won't kill them.  Would probably pin Pats inside their own 20.  But a turnover would be awful at this stage.
GlennClarkRadio	Glenn Clark	204774888	Baltimore	2020-11-16 03:02:28	@bgpowelll There's no real way to quantify that. But the #Patriots are doing a hell of a job of going right after the #Ravens' weakness. They always do.

Keep this ball for the rest of the half and get points.  They get the ball to start the 2nd half so if they pull it off it keeps the #Ravens off the field for a while real time.  #GoPats

_AndrewCallahan	Andrew Callahan	2868106332	Boston, MA	2020-11-16 01:49:36	As the #Ravens keep driving, they've reverted back to more typical alignments and positions (Winovich at OLB, two traditional ILBs in 2-4-5. Or Dugger/Phillips at ILB in 2-3-6.)  Bottom line: Tricky speed/strength balance in the box. Pats may already ditching their initial plan.

The Ravens had a penalty on the punt because the Ravens def had his back to PR when he signaled fair catch, and refs were slow to blow whistle after PR caught it. Bad officiating

Blitzalytics	Blitzalytics	922978452411596801		2020-11-15 23:19:28	Who will win tonight's #SNF matchup between the #Ravens and #Patriots? #BALvsNE #RavensFlock #GoPats
Mark_Dhooge	Mark Dhooge	275656121	Hingham, MA	2020-11-15 23:16:48	Lastly, #Patriots need to get creative in order to get Jakobi Meyers the ball. After 30 targets over the last 3 games, look for the #Ravens to try and take him away. When Meyers does get 1 on 1 Cam Newton needs to get him the ball
Mark_Dhooge	Mark Dhooge	275656121	Hingham, MA	2020-11-15 23:16:48	Also, whether it‚Äôs play-action or straight drop backs, Cam Newton has to take advantage of the middle of the field on early downs in the passing game. #Ravens like to mix up where they send pressure and can sometimes leave the middle open
Mark_Dhooge	Mark Dhooge	275656121	Hingham, MA	2020-11-15 23:16:48	It‚Äôs obvious, but the #Patriots have to keep 3rd downs manageable. #Ravens are a top 3rd down D (25% if you exclude KC game). I see the #Pats being conservative on offense to try to shorten this game. To be successful, and help their D, they need to see a lot of 3rd &amp; shorts
Mark_Dhooge	Mark Dhooge	275656121	Hingham, MA	2020-11-15 23:16:48	Three keys to the #Patriots offense vs the #Ravens tonight:  Keep 3rd downs manageable.  Attack middle of the field on early downs in the passing game.  Get creative feeding Jakobi Meyers.  @MikeReiss @ezlazar

Yoshi2052	KingMoose	344130534		2020-11-12 21:06:54	Brown has seen what looks like a modest increase in involvement, but this difference is entirely explained by the fact that he missed 2+ games in 2019 (PIT H2, CIN, SEA).

bsmolka	Bo Smolka	36724078	Baltimore, MD	2020-11-10 17:13:28	The #Ravens defensive rankings at the season's midpoint:  Overall: 8th (324.9 yd/gm allowed) Rushing: 8th (101.8) Passing: 10th (223.1)  Other: Scoring: 1st (17.8 points/gm) Yards allowed/carry: 20th (4.52) Third-down conv D: 2nd (32.29) Red-zone D: 30th (77.78) Sacks: T6th (24)
Yoshi2052	KingMoose	344130534		2020-11-10 17:08:04	Note that IND twice put Harris (a WR) in the backfield next to Rivers (those are the 01 snaps). Looks like the #Ravens were in zone on the 1st, and maybe left him uncovered on the 2nd. It's a good way to force an uneven matchup if the D isn't paying attention.  #RavensFlock
Yoshi2052	KingMoose	344130534		2020-11-10 17:08:04	Finally, here's how the #Ravens responded to various personnel groupings from the #Colts (and results).   This table really shows the success on the ground of 11 vs. nickel. Not much else worked in volume. IND mostly kept attacking 5 DBs through the air via 11.  #RavensFlock https://t.co/dF6NkZ6GQG
KDPomp	Bob Pompeani	39885227	Pittsburgh, PA	2020-11-10 17:00:03	FYI ‚Äî All #Ravens players who were quarantined last week DID play on Sunday.  #Steelers are hoping for the same this week

Yoshi2052	KingMoose	344130534		2020-11-10 16:53:38	The #Colts played mostly 11 personnel. That's where they found success on the ground as well: 7.6 YPC, 75% SRate, 58% PosEPA (again, negative EPP from FR TD).  #Ravens #RavensFlock https://t.co/vMVu2rSgvz
Yoshi2052	KingMoose	344130534		2020-11-10 16:49:53	#Ravens spent most of the game in nickel. Rivers only completed 60% of his passes against 5 DBs, but the Colts ran for 5.6 YPC (also higher SRate, higher PosEPA%; low EPP is due to FRTD). Most of those results came against the standard nickel (13 for 78).  #RavensFlock https://t.co/JDefPBIQqR

Since then, Samuel has developed into one of the more fun &amp; versatile offensive weapons in the #NFL.  Smart group of folks, #Ravens' fans. https://t.co/yMkkS4mUcm

Lamar Jackson's) and adaptability.   Baltimore adjusting to defend the Colts' short passes and get LJ into a rhythm shows why the team is a title contender.

However, playing down four (Calais, Marlon, LJ, Tavon) impact starters at key positions and still managing to be a menace the entire day speaks to how good they actually are.

The offense in the second half was much better.  Greg Roman needs to be more consistent, and the offensive line needs to play MUCH better.
